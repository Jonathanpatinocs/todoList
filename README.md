# Todo List using Javascript, CSS, and HTML bundled with webpack.

# Purpose 
The goal of this project was to create a personal todo list website from scratch and practice my Javascript skills and using a Javascript bundler. Skills include using class constructers and DOM manipulation to create, delete, and update Todo entries and todo folders. I stored the data using localStorage of Web Storage API. Overall I learned a lot from building this project, especially in problem solving as I had to overcome many challenges along the way.
I plan to keep adding features and build upon the website in the future!
